00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.500
Understanding the equipment flashing the BCM

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:12.499
Safety first:

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.099
When working in the shop,

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:16.299
always follow the safety guidelines

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.066
provided in service information,

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.766
tool operation manuals,

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.499
and other technical literature.

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.966
To protect yourself from injury,

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:27.466
wear personal protective equipment (PPE),

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.599
dress appropriately, work professionally,

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.866
and correctly handle tools and equipment.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.966
Flashing or programming means to update

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.699
the software in a module.

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.432
Programming is similar to applying software

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:44.299
updates on a computer or a gaming console.

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.933
A module may need flashed to update

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:48.766
the software.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.066
This is common to fix software-related issues

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.532
that arise over time.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.266
When a new module is installed,

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.766
it has to be programmed.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.033
Most vehicles program the VIN into the module,

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.199
which can only be done once.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.833
This prevents removing the module and

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:08.099
reinstalling it into a different vehicle.

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.366
To flash a BCM, a factory-level scan tool

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.666
or a pass-through device

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.132
is needed to connect the vehicle.

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:18.433
A subscription to the vehicle manufacturerâ€™s

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:20.833
service information or programming system

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:21.733
is also required.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.166
Many aftermarket companies sell

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.699
programming tools called pass-through devices.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:31.466
These devices must meet the SAE J2534

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.032
standard for programming.

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.999
This allow you to connect to the vehicle and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.233
program modules

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:39.166
but a subscription to the factory service

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.832
information is still required.

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.799
It is essential that the pass-through device

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.566
or scan tool is equipped with the latest software

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.666
before performing service programming.

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.399
Read and follow ALL precautions and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.566
procedures when programming a module.

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:57.066
Failure to follow the directions can result

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.999
in a programming failure and a useless module.

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.066
Stable battery voltage

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.599
is critical during programming

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.366
Any fluctuation, spiking,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.466
over voltage,

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:09.999
or loss of voltage will interrupt programming.

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:13.333
If the recommended battery tool is not available,

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.566
DO NOT connect a battery charger,

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:16.566
Insted

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:19.666
connect a fully charged 12 V jumper or

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:21.932
booster pack disconnected from the

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.499
AC voltage supply.

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:27.399
Enter the simulation to practice flashing a BCM.
